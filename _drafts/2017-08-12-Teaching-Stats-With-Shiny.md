title: Using R and Shiny to Teach Statistics
---

I've been thinking a lot about how to scale data science
capabilities internally. While hiring more data scientists
is half the battle, there's a larger underlying need for
a better approach to less difficult, but much more common,

Not every problem needs a complex neural network, or a
well-tuned machine learning model. Sometimes, something as
simple as applying some fundamental statistical knowledge
and using a programming language to do data analysis can be
just as, if not more, effective in increasing the capabilities
and the resulting outcomes.

One thing I've started to do is run R Bootcamps, not to teach
complex machine learning, but simply as an introduction to
data importing, cleaning, analysis, visualization and
presentation.
