title: Trump Speech Generator using Recursive Neural Networks
excerpt: "Scraping 55 Trump Speeches using Python, and generating Trump-like speeches using torch-rnn"

---

With Trump's victory, I thought it would be interesting to scope out some Trump-related datasets and get some practice with different machine learning algorithms. I've seen some work with generative text with <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">Markov Chains</a>, but thought a <a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/">Recurrent Neural Network</a> might be a little more fun to play with.
<h2>Web Scraping</h2>
Grabbing a large enough dataset was the first problem to solve. I did find a <a href="https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/trump-speeches">Github that had some Trump speeches</a> but the data was 3 months old as of this post. I decided instead to create a simple scraper to capture all 55 of his speeches from <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/">The American Presidency Project</a>. It had been several years since I've really coded with Python, so a simple scraper seemed like a good way to get back into it.

The code itself is very simple and not very elegant, but it gets the job done. I used Beautiful Soup to target the links on the main listing of speeches, and a second scraper to capture each individual speech. There's a few things I still would like to do, just like error catching, and figuring out a more elegant way to write the data into text, but for the purposes of creating a RNN, the script works just fine.

Before I started working on the script, though, I threw the code up on Twitter to a few friends of mine from the #rstats world and before I knew it, <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">David Robinson</a>, of Stack Overflow, had already done an interesting bit of analysis on the text data.

<h2>Recurrent Neural Network</h2>
This part proved to be the hardest. The plan was use torch-rnn to build a neural network using the speeches from the scraper to generate new text. But I couldn't get torch to work properly on Windows, so I had to install Ubuntu to get a Linux session going, and then start working through dependencies to install everything I need to build then neural net.

<a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn">torch-rnn</a> was based on <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn">char-rnn</a> but with the added benefit of using Torch which can take advantage of GPU processing for faster training. Installing Torch was relatively straight-forward, so long as you follow the <a href="http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_">instructions on the Torch website,</a> and don't decide to try installing luarocks and other packages through Ubunutu's package manager instead.

With Torch installed and tested, the computer rebooted and secure-bios turned off (can't forget that step..), I finally could get to the task of training the rnn. The rest of the steps were trivial. With the data copied over to the torch-rnn data folder, I trained for several days (!), a total of 522000 iterations and 2000 epochs.

With training done, I was able to sample using the most recent checkpoint to get some pretty decent (if sometimes nonsensical) results. Here are some results along with the text used to seed the generation.
<blockquote>
<div class="UFICommentContent"><span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody"><strong>"Make America":</strong> Make America safe again.And we are going to win the White House.It's going to be a signature to restore dignity and opportunity to every child in this country who have suffered so much previous to the problem is that the American people will send new skyscrapers into the World Trade Organization.</span></span></div>
<div class="UFICommentContent"><strong>"Data Science":</strong> Data science if I believe it, and continued to shut representative regulations on the patriotic security interests of the media wall. The problem is that couple -in illegal immigrant required this nation. American workers.

<div class="UFICommentContent">Although the results are mostly nonsensical and sometimes not even English, we can get a good sense of what the RNN is seeing in Trump's speeches. Phrases like security interests, illegal immigrant, American workers, great jobs and $800 million jobs, poor African American communities, are all turns of phrase that can easily be read in Trump's voice.</div>

<h2 class="UFICommentContent">Next Steps</h2>
55 speeches in the grand scheme of things isn't that large. The entire dataset is slightly under one megabyte. I could definitely use more training data to help the RNN with its output. Despite all that, it was a pretty interesting project and a great way to dip my toes into neural nets.
