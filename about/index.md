I am a Data Scientist at [RBC](http://rbc.com). I received my BSC in Psychology,
with minors in English and Philosophy from the University of Toronto.

I'm interested in statistics, machine learning, programming in R and Python,
as well as developing R packages, and other tooling to make the lives of data
scientists easier.

Recent Work
============

* [trump-scraper](https://github.com/PedramNavid/trump_speeches): a Python script
that scrapes 55 of Donald Trump's speeches prior to his presidency. Used by
David Robinson from Stack Overflow, among others, for analysis. I also used this
data to create a Trump Speech Generator using a Recursive Neural Network.
* [TTC-Aliens](https://github.com/PedramNavid/TTC-Aliens): Python package that
randomly replaces the occasional tweet from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)
with warnings about incoming aliens.
* [GooeyPi](https://github.com/PedramNavid/GooeyPi): Cross-platform wxPython
front-end to PyInstaller.
